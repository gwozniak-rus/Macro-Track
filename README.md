### Description:

A `user` has the ability to enter the amount of calories per `meal`, and can see a list of each meal in a table below

    - First iteration: 


### Architecture:
- First iteration: 
  - A simple bootstrap UI (form, table) that allows a user to enter in two properties (meal name, calories) and allow for 
  saving. Once persisted give the user feedback alerting them that it successfully saved or errored giving feedback.
  On success, the new entry is appended to the table, on error the error is propagated to the user
